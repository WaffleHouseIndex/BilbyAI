## Development Workflow

### Iterative Development Process
1. **Plan** - Break each stage into 3-5 day increments
2. **Prototype** - Build minimal working version
3. **Test** - Validate against success criteria
4. **Refine** - Improve based on testing
5. **Deploy** - Push to staging environment
6. **Review** - Assess and plan next increment

### Quality Gates
- Each stage must pass all tests before proceeding
- Code must compile and pass linting
- Database migrations must be reversible
- Security review for each stage
- Performance benchmarks met

### Risk Management
- Maximum 3 attempts per blocking issue
- Document failed approaches and alternatives
- Have backup plans for external service dependencies
- Regular compliance and security reviews

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Frontend
- **Next.js 14** - App Router, Server Components, TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **Shadcn/ui** - Component library for consistency
- **WebSockets** - Real-time transcript updates

### Backend  
- **Next.js API Routes** - Serverless functions
- **Prisma ORM** - Type-safe database access
- **Supabase** - PostgreSQL with real-time features
- **Auth0** - Authentication and authorization

### External Services
